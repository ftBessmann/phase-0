**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

User experience (UX) is how a person feels when interfacing with a system. User experiences are different across websites.
Design deals with problem solving. Design must be based on the goals, values, production process and products of its website.
User experience is different from usability. Usability embraces only user-friendliness and efficiency of the interface.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

User experience design is based on how a person feels when interfacing with a website, a web application or desktop software. UX designers study and evaluate the ease of use, ergonomics, utility, performance, accessibility of Web-based products. Implementation of the user-centered design principles improves effectiveness of interactions between users and UX systems.
