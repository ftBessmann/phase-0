**3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

**4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

 I want my target audience to see my portfolio, read the information presented on the site and contact me.

**5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

 Web design involves problem solving. Design must be tailored to the goals, values, production process and products of the website. User experiences will be different across websites.

 There’s an element of subjectivity in assessment of the effectiveness of a user experience design. Therefore, the evaluation cannot be based on statistics only. 

 User experience differs from usability. UX addresses a user’s feelings when using a system, while usability is about the user-friendliness and efficiency of the interface.

**6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

 User experience is how a person feels when interfacing with a website, a web application or desktop software. The websites today are built taking into consideration the experience of the people who will use the websites. UX designers look at such things as ease of use, perception of the value of the site, utility, efficiency in performing tasks, accessibility, etc. It improves the performance of a
 site.
