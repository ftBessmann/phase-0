**1. What is a wireframe?**

 A wireframe is the layout of the elements of the webpage.

**2. What are the benefits of wireframing?**

The functionality of the webpage can be adjusted to how the developer wants the user to interact and navigate with the web page without the distraction of colors or typeface.

**3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

I would prefer proceeding from sketch to visual. 

**4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I stuck with my first idea.

**5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

How does the target user think? What are his aims and interests? What qualities of me would he like to find while navigating my web-site? What tools, colors, organisation of information can help to present my mindset, skills, interests to the user?

At the end of the day, I'm looking for likely-minded users who can become my employers or customers. 

I read articles from Smashingmagazine.

**6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I found making a wireframe tedious.
