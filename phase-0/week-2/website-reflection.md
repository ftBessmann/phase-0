**1. How was your experience translating a wireframe into HTML?**

Translation of a wireframe into HTML made reconsider the header of the index page for a website and think over what other elements (images) could be included later on to the blog index page. 

**2. What new tricks or elements did you learn about in HTML?**

I haven't noticed before that the footer is a part of the body. The validator check of my code revealed this flaw.

**3. Are you excited to start incorporating the design you chose next week?**

I am curious about incorporating the design and formatting the page.
