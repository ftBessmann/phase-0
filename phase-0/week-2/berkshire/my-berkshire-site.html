It was entertaining to translate my previous learning with HTML into an actual site.

Researching and using semantic HTML5 elements was easy and fast. 

Keeping to the best practices of HTML writing such as no formatting takes time and attention.

Advantages of HTML

Easy to use. 
Loose syntax.
Supported on most browsers.
Widely used.
Free.
Easy to learn & code.

Disadvantages of HTML

Sometimes, the structuring of HTML documents is hard to grasp. 
You have to keep up with deprecated tags, and make sure not to use them. 
Security features offered by HTML are limited.

I have many tricks to remember how to write HTML as I'm pretty new to it. But I paid attention that one should indent code to show parent/child relationships and emphasize hierarchy, always declare a doctype at the beginning of a document. The structure of a document always includes a head with a title inside and a body. To a certain extent, the structure resembles matreshka (Russian doll with several dolls one inside another).  Each element of the structure is begins and ends with its name (for example, <title> </title>)
