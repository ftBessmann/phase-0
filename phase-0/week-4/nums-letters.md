**1. What does puts do?**

Puts ("put string") simply outputs to the console with a new line. It doesn't pass on any information.

**2. What is an integer? What is a float?**

An integer is a real number written without a fraction or a decimal.

A float is an inexact real number with decimal points.

**3. What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**
Integers in comparison with floats define indivisible objects.
Integers are most commonly used to program real world objects.
Floats are often used to measure weight, height and speed, for academic research, or graphics. They are more precise than integers.

'''ruby
puts 24 * 7 * 52
puts 60 * 24 * (365 * 10 + 2)
'''

**1. How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

addition: +
subtraction: -
multiplication: *
division: /

**2. What is the difference between integers and floats?**

Integers are used to indivisible objects and have no decimal points.

**3. What is the difference between integer and float division?**

Interger division also results in an integer.
If and operation involves at least one float number, the result will be a float.

**4. What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

Strings are groups of letters, puncuation, digits, symbools and spaces between them: in other words, textual information. They are used to write text.

**5. What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

Local variables are variables valid within a local area of a Ruby source code, or local scope. They exist within the definition of a Ruby module, method, class.

**6. How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**
This challenge was quite easy. I directed my attention to some details of Ruby basics that I needed to review.
