Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a new repo one has to press “+” located in the top right of the navigation panel and select “New Repository”. Then enter the name for the repository, choose whether it’s public or private, add a license (if applicable) and click the “Create Repository” green button.
To clone a repo one has to open the terminal, navigate to either Desktop or phase-0 directory, then copy the URL of the created/forked repository and enter the command in the terminal: git clone <copied URL>.


Describe what open source means.
Open source software is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think that Open Source is a good practice and can be useful for freelance developers and small companies looking to promote their ideas and collaborate. There are also social initiatives on the Internet that can be sustained by means of Open Source. I find it absolutely realistic and reasonable in certain spheres but to avoid mess one has to adhere to the rules. One should also point out that Open Source can be seen as a creative field for collaboration of people who otherwise would not even have a chance to contact each other.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
A license makes it easy for others to contribute to a project without having to seek special permission from the author. It also protects the author as the original creator, making sure the author at least gets some credit. It also helps to prevent others from claiming one's work as their own.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The challenge elaborated on the methods of creation and cloning of a repository on GitHub as well as committing and pulling the changes made to a file from the local to the remote repository by means of creation of a temporary feature branch. I noticed that the arguments in the commands such as -b, -d represent the first letters of the key words (branch, delete) and can be often guessed. For a while, I was distracted with the constantly appearing requests to provide the user name and password when pushing data to GitHub.
