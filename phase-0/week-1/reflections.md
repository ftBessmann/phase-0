1.1 Think About Time Reflection
The most memorable time management and productivity ideas presented in the adviced sources were the concept and methods of time boxing as well as the ways to get ingaged with the task at hand such as mindfulness, starting small to achieve big goals, getting into the flow zone.

Time boxing refers to self-limiting of one's time bounderies meant for work and stopping work when the limit is reached even if the work hasn't been completed. The approach includes the "pomodoro technique" under which work is organized in 25-minute sessions with 5-minute breaks and "speed dating" that is known for 7-minute timeboxes. Each timebox is followed by the progress revision and mini SWOT-analysis of the tasks.

I would prefer to use the "pomodoro technique" for solo challenges and the "speed dating" for paired sessions. The "pomodoro technique" provides time to gradually focus on the tasks and allows for deeper involvement into them. Meanwhile, the "speed dating" technique could be useful when constant procedural collaboration and periodical comparison of results is needed. 

I mostly try to logically organize my tasks and write weekly lists to manage time. My lists divide activities and tasks into obligatory and complementary. Then the activities can be categorized by the sphere of life (work, education, health, family, leisure, etc.) and subcategorized further on into projects in they refer to work or subjects if they relate to education. I also highlight the urgent tasks and block the tasks according either to the persons involved, or to the process mode  (thinking, communication, travel, etc.). Pauses are didicated to meditation, meals and sports. It seems my current strategy does work, maybe, not as good as I want but most people consider me good at multitasking and often ask how I manage to have all the stuff done.

I do constantly work on the improvement of my focus and attention by means of mediation and yoga. I'm also engaged into many physical and mental activies that contribute to the brain's flexibility, memory and attention. But still, I will implement time boxing for the problem-solving tasks because I notice that my obession with getting to the core of the things and a habit to see everything from all possible perspectives influences the speed of the work process and often drives me out of the time limits.

I'm also fond of essensialism as an approach to life and, therefore, consider the basis of time management and productivity to be the ability to determine what really matters in the long-term and get it done first and by all means. 

The main point of my overall plan for Phase 0 time management is to switch on the timer )))

1.2 The Command Line Reflection
A shell is a macro processor that executes commands. A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language. Bash is the default shell for the GNU operating system. It currently runs on the majority of Unix versions. Other shells include sh, ksh and csh.

The most challenging for me in going through this material was to understand the information presented in the video. Reading of the additional material and accomplishing tasks from the Command Line Crash Course clarified all the issues.
I was able to successfully use all of the commands.
In my opinion, the most important commands and arguments to know are pwd, cd, mkdir, rmdir, ls, touch, rm, find, grep, cp, *, !, ?.
The meaning of the commands is as follows:
-pwd => print working directory;

-ls => list directory; 

-mv => move a file or directory;

-cd => change directory;

-../ => go one directory up;

-touch => create an empty file;

-mkdir => make directory;

-less => show the contents of the file page by page;

-rmdir => remove directory;

-rm => remove a file;

-help => open manual.

1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection 
To create a new repo one has to press “+” located in the top right of the navigation panel and select “New Repository”. Then enter the name for the repository, choose whether it’s public or private, add a license (if applicable) and click the “Create Repository” green button.

To fork a repo one has to access the source repository, click a “Fork” button in the top right corner of the navigation panel and choose your GitHub account to fork the repository into.

To clone a repo one has to open the terminal, navigate to either Desktop or phase-0 directory, then copy the URL of the forked repository and enter the command in the terminal: git clone <copied URL>.

One needs to fork a repository instead of creating a new one when one wants to have a copy of an already existing repository belonging to smb else and to work on it without modification of the source repository.

The process of setting up git and GitHub went smoothly on my side as I followed the instructions. Meanwhile, I’ve learnt that git is a distributed version (revision, source) control system initially designed for Linux. It is free and widely used. GitHub is a platform for online collaboration of developers, designers and writers. The service has not only an online interface but also offers desktop and mobile applications where the local copies of repositories can be kept.
