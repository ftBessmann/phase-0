**1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
*I had minor issues with pushing commits to the remote repo prior to the GPS session.*

**2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
*During the GPS, the following commands were clarified:
'''
git <command> --help
git fetch
'''
We’ve also discussed the topic of merge conflicts’ resolution.* 

**3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
*I asked what “git fetch” means.*

**What still confuses you about git?**
*Nothing. I understood that fetch is the opposite of push.*

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
*I’m glad to have paired with Regina. She was open for discussion and easy-going. I wonder if we have exceeded the session’s time limit a little.*
